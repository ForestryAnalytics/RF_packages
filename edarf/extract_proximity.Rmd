 Methods to extract proximity matrices from random forests

#### Description
Extracts proximity matrices from random forest objects from the party, randomForest, randomForestSRC,
or ranger packages

#### Usage

extract_proximity(fit, newdata)

#### Arguments

* ``fit``: object of class "RandomForest", "randomForest", "rfsrc", or "ranger"
* ``newdata``: new data with the same columns as the data used for fit
* ``...``: arguments to be passed to extract_proximity



#### Examples
```{r}
library(randomForest)
fit = randomForest(hp ~ ., mtcars, proximity = TRUE)
extract_proximity(fit)
fit = randomForest(Species ~ ., iris, proximity = TRUE)
extract_proximity(fit)
```

##### Value
an n x n matrix where position i, j gives the proportion of times observation i and j are in the same
teriminal node across all trees
