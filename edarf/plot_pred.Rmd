## plot_pred Plot predicted versus observed values

#### Description
Plot predicted versus observed values

#### Usage
<pre><code>
plot_pred(predicted, observed, perfect_line = TRUE, outlier_idx = NULL,
labs = NULL, xlab = "Observed", ylab = "Predicted", title = "")
<code></pre>

#### Arguments
* predicted numeric vector of predictions
* observed numeric vector of observations
* perfect_line logical whether to plot a blue 45 degree line on which perfect predictions would fall
* outlier_idx integer indices of outliers to be labelled between the predicted and observed
* value pairs are labeled an outlier
* labs character labels for points, applied to a subset determined by the ’outlier_criterion’
* xlab character label for the x-axis, defaults to "Observed"
* ylab character label for the y-axis, defaults to "Predicted"
* title character title defaults to ""

#### Value
a ggplot object

#### Examples
library(randomForest)
library(edarf)
fit = randomForest(hp ~ ., mtcars)
pred = predict(fit, newdata = mtcars)
plot_pred(pred, mtcars$hp,
outlier_idx = which(abs(pred - mtcars$hp) > .5 * sd(mtcars$hp)),
labs = row.names(mtcars))
