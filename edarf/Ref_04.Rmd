plot_pred Plot predicted versus observed values
Description
Plot predicted versus observed values
Usage
plot_pred(predicted, observed, perfect_line = TRUE, outlier_idx = NULL,
labs = NULL, xlab = "Observed", ylab = "Predicted", title = "")
6 plot_prox
Arguments
predicted numeric vector of predictions
observed numeric vector of observations
perfect_line logical whether to plot a blue 45 degree line on which perfect predictions would
fall
outlier_idx integer indices of outliers to be labelled between the predicted and observed
value pairs are labeled an outlier
labs character labels for points, applied to a subset determined by the ’outlier_criterion’
xlab character label for the x-axis, defaults to "Observed"
ylab character label for the y-axis, defaults to "Predicted"
title character title defaults to ""
Value
a ggplot object
Examples
library(randomForest)
library(edarf)
fit = randomForest(hp ~ ., mtcars)
pred = predict(fit, newdata = mtcars)
plot_pred(pred, mtcars$hp,
outlier_idx = which(abs(pred - mtcars$hp) > .5 * sd(mtcars$hp)),
labs = row.names(mtcars))
