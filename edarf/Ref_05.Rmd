plot_prox Plot principle components of the proximity matrix
Description
Plot principle components of the proximity matrix
Usage
plot_prox(pca, dims = 1:2, labels = NULL, alpha = 1, alpha_label = NULL,
color = "black", color_label = NULL, shape = "1", shape_label = NULL,
size = 2, size_label = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, title = "")
plot_prox 7
Arguments
pca a prcomp object, pca of an n x n matrix giving the proportion of times across all
trees that observation i,j are in the same terminal node
dims integer vector of length 2 giving indices for the dimensions of pca to be plotted
labels length n character vector giving observation labels
alpha optional continuous vector of length n make points/labels transparent or a numeric
of length 1 giving the alpha of all points/labels
alpha_label character legend title if alpha parameter used
color optional discrete vector of length n which colors the points/labels or a character
vector giving the color of all points/labels
color_label character legend title if color parameter is used
shape optional discrete vector of length n which shapes points (not applicable if labels
used) or a character vector of length 1 which gives the shape of all points
shape_label character legend title if shape parameter is used
size optional continuous vector of length n which sizes points or labels or a numeric
of length 1 which gives the sizes of all the points
size_label character legend title if size parameter used
xlab character x-axis label
ylab character y-axis label
title character plot title
Value
a ggplot object

prox = extract_proximity(fit)
pca = prcomp(prox, scale = TRUE)
plot_prox(pca, labels = row.names(mtcars))
fit = randomForest(Species ~ ., iris, proximity = TRUE)
prox = extract_proximity(fit)
pca = prcomp(prox, scale = TRUE)

8 variable_importance
variable_importance Variable importance using random forests
Description
Computes local or aggregate variable importance for a set of predictors from a fitted random forest
object from the party, randomForest, randomForestSRC, or ranger package
Usage
variable_importance(fit, vars, interaction, nperm, data, ...)
Arguments
fit object of class ’RandomForest’, ’randomForest’, ’rfsrc’, or ‘ranger‘
vars character, variables to find the importance of
interaction logcal, compute the joint and additive importance for observations (type = "local")
or variables type = "aggregate"
nperm positive integer giving the number of times to permute the indicated variables
(default 10)
data optional (unless using randomForest) data.frame with which to calculate importance
... additional arguments to be passed to permutationImportance.
Value
a named list of vars with the return from permutationImportance for each.
