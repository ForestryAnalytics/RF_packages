## ``Node_cost`` Information Gain

#### Description
Compute the cost function of a tree node

### Usage
<pre><code>
Node_cost(y, Inv_Cov_Y, Command)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``y``: Output Features for the samples of the node
* ``Inv_Cov_Y``: Inverse of Covariance matrix of Output Response matrix for MRF(Input [0 0;0 0] for RF)
* ``Command``: 1 for univariate Regression Tree (corresponding to RF) and 2 for Multivariate Regression Tree (corresponding to MRF)

#### Examples
```{r}
library(MultivariateRandomForest)
y=matrix(runif(10*2),10,2)
Inv_Cov_Y=solve(cov(y))
Command=2
#Command=2 for MRF and 1 for RF
#This function calculates information gain of a node
Cost=Node_cost(y,Inv_Cov_Y,Command)
```
#### Details
In multivariate trees (MRF) node cost is measured as the sum of squares of the Mahalanobis distance to capture the correlations in the data whereas in univariate trees node cost is measured as the sum of Euclidean distance square. Mahalanobis Distance captures the distance of the sample point from the mean of the node along the principal component axes.

#### Value
cost or entropy of samples in a node of a tree
