predicting Prediction of testing sample in a node
Description
Provides the value of a testing sample in a node which refers to which child node it will go using
the splitting criteria of the tree node or prediction results if the node is a leaf.
Usage
predicting(Single_Model, i, X_test, Variable_number)
Arguments
Single_Model Model of a particular tree
i Number of split. Used as an index, which indicates where in the list the splitting
criteria of this split has been stored.
X_test Testing samples of size Q x N, Q is the number of testing samples and N is the
number of features (same order and size used as training)
Variable_number
Number of Output Features
Details
The function considers the output at a particular node. If the node is a leaf, the average of output
responses is returned as prediction result. For a non-leaf node, the direction of left or right node is
decided based on the node threshold and splitting feature value.
Value
Prediction result of a testing samples in a node
