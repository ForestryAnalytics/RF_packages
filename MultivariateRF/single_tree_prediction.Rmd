## single_tree_prediction
Prediction of Testing Samples for single tree

#### Description
Predicts the output responses of testing samples based on the input regression tree

#### Usage
<pre><code>
 single_tree_prediction(Single_Model, X_test, Variable_number)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* Single_Model Random Forest or Multivariate Random Forest Model of a particular tree
* X_test Testing samples of size Q x N, Q is the number of testing samples and N is the
number of features (same order and size used as training)
* Variable_number Number of Output Features

#### Details
A regression tree model contains splitting criteria for all the splits in the tree and output responses
of training samples in the leaf nodes. A testing sample using these criteria will reach a leaf node
and the average of the Output response vectors in the leaf node is considered as the prediction of
the testing sample.

#### Value
Prediction result of the Testing samples for a particular tree
