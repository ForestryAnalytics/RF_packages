Imputation Imputation of a numerical vector
Description
Imputes the values of the vector that are NaN
Usage
Imputation(XX)
6 Node_cost
Arguments
XX a vector of size N x 1
Details
If a value is missing, it will be replaced by an imputed value that is an average of previous and next
value. If previous or next value is also missing, the closest value is used as the imputed value.
Value
Imputed vector of size N x 1
Node_cost Information Gain
Description
Compute the cost function of a tree node
Usage
Node_cost(y, Inv_Cov_Y, Command)
Arguments
y Output Features for the samples of the node
Inv_Cov_Y Inverse of Covariance matrix of Output Response matrix for MRF(Input [0 0;0
0] for RF)
Command 1 for univariate Regression Tree (corresponding to RF) and 2 for Multivariate
Regression Tree (corresponding to MRF)
Details
In multivariate trees (MRF) node cost is measured as the sum of squares of the Mahalanobis distance
to capture the correlations in the data whereas in univariate trees node cost is measured as the sum
of Euclidean distance square. Mahalanobis Distance captures the distance of the sample point from
the mean of the node along the principal component axes.
Value
cost or entropy of samples in a node of a tree
