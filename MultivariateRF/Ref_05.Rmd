split_node Splitting Criteria of all the nodes of the tree
Description
Stores the Splitting criteria of all the nodes of a tree in a list
Usage
split_node(X, Y, m_feature, Index, i, model, min_leaf, Inv_Cov_Y, Command)
Arguments
X Input Training matrix of size M x N, M is the number of training samples and N
is the number of features
Y Output Training response of size M x T, M is the number of samples and T is
the number of output responses
m_feature Number of randomly selected features considered for a split in each regression
tree node
Index Index of training samples
i Number of split. Used as an index, which indicates where in the list the splitting
criteria of this split will be stored.
model A list of lists with the spliting criteria of all the node splits. In each iteration, a
new list is included with the spliting criteria of the new split of a node.
min_leaf Minimum number of samples in the leaf node. If a node has less than or, equal
to min_leaf samples, then there will be no splitting in that node and the node is
a leaf node. Valid input is a positive integer and less than or equal to M (number
of training samples)
Inv_Cov_Y Inverse of Covariance matrix of Output Response matrix for MRF(Give Zero for
RF)
Command 1 for univariate Regression Tree (corresponding to RF) and 2 for Multivariate
Regression Tree (corresponding to MRF)
Details
This function calculates the splitting criteria of a node and stores the information in a list format.
If the node is a parent node, then indices of left and right nodes and feature number and threshold
value of the feature for the split are stored. If the node is a leaf, the output feature matrix of the
samples for the node are stored as a list.
Value
Model: A list of lists with the splitting criteria of all the split of the nodes. In each iteration, the
Model is updated with a new list that includes the splitting criteria of the new split of a node.
