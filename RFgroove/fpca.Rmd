```



#### Description

Compute the functional PCA from a set of curves.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
fpca( x, nbasisInit, propVar = 0.9, reconstruct = FALSE,
      varName = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``x``: The set of curves.
* ``nbasisInit``: The number of initial spline coefficients.
* ``propVar``: The proportion of explained variance.
* ``reconstruct``: Should the data be reconstruct after dimension reduction ?
* ``varName``: The name of the current functional variable.
* ``verbose``: Should the details be printed.

#### Details
The Functional PCA is performed in two steps. First we express each discretized curves as a linear
combination of 'nbasisInit' spline basis functions. Then a multivariate PCA is computed on the spline coefficients. The final number of principal components is chosen such that the proportion of explained variance is larger than 'propVar'.

#### Value
A list with two components:
* design The matrix of the principal components ;
* smoothData The reconstructed data if 'reconstruct == TRUE'.


#### Examples

```{r}
data(toyRegFD)
x <- toyRegFD$FDlist[[1]]
dim(x)
```

```{r}
PCs <- fpca(x=x, nbasisInit=32, propVar=.9, reconstruct=TRUE)
summary(PCs)
```

```{r}
plot(x[1,])
lines(PCs$smoothData[1,], col=2)
```
