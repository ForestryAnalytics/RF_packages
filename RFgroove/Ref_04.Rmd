selectFunctional Grouped variable selection procedure for functional data
Description
Backward variable selection procedure for multivariate functional data which is a set of p functional
covariates and n observations of dimension N.
8 selectFunctional
Usage
selectFunctional( FDlist, ydata, normalize=TRUE,
dimensionReductionMethod=c("fpca", "wave"),
nbasisInit, verbose=TRUE, ...)
Arguments
FDlist A p-dimensional list containing the set of functional variables which are matrices
of size n × N.
ydata The outcome data. Must be a factor for classification.
normalize Should the functions be normalized ?
dimensionReductionMethod
The dimension reduction method, ‘fpca’ for Functional Principal Component
Analysis or ‘wave’ for the multiple wavelet thresholding.
nbasisInit The number of initial spline coefficients.
verbose Should the details be printed.
... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
Value
An object of class fRFE which is a list with the following components:
nselected The number of selected functional variables ;
selection The selected functional variables ;
selectionIndexes
The indexes of selected functional variables in the input data ‘FDlist’ ;
error The prediction error computed in each iteration of the backward procedure ;
typeRF The type of the forests, classification or regression ;
ranking The final ranking of the functional variables ;
rankingIndexes The final ranking indexes of the functional variables.
