## variable importance p-values

#### Description

Compute variable importance with p-values. For high dimensional data, the fast method of Janitza
et al. (2016) can be used. The permutation approach of Altmann et al. (2010) is computationally
intensive but can be used with all kinds of data. See below for details.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
importance_pvalues(x, method = c("janitza", "altmann"),
num.permutations = 100, formula = NULL, data = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
x ranger or holdoutRF object.
method Method to compute p-values. Use "janitza" for the method by Janitza et al. (2016) or "altmann" for the non-parametric method by Altmann et al. (2010).
num.permutations: Number of permutations. Used in the "altmann" method only.
formula:  Object of class formula or character describing the model to fit. Used in the "altmann" method only.
data Training data of class data.frame or matrix. Used in the "altmann" method only.
... Further arguments passed to ranger(). Used in the "altmann" method only.


### Examples

```{r}
require(ranger)
## Janitza's p-values with corrected Gini importance
n <- 50
p <- 400
dat <- data.frame(y = factor(rbinom(n, 1, .5)), replicate(p, runif(n)))
rf.sim <- ranger(y ~ ., dat, importance = "impurity_corrected")
importance_pvalues(rf.sim, method = "janitza")
## Permutation p-values
## Not run:
rf.iris <- ranger(Species ~ ., data = iris, importance = 'permutation')
importance_pvalues(rf.iris, method = "altmann", formula = Species ~ ., data = iris)
## End(Not run)
```
#### Details
The method of Janitza et al. (2016) uses a clever trick: With an unbiased variable importance
measure, the importance values of non-associated variables vary randomly around zero. Thus,
all non-positive importance values are assumed to correspond to these non-associated variables and
they are used to construct a distribution of the importance under the null hypothesis of no association
to the response. Since only the non-positive values of this distribution can be observed, the positive
values are created by mirroring the negative distribution. See Janitza et al. (2016) for #### Details.
The method of Altmann et al. (2010) uses a simple permutation test: The distribution of the importance
under the null hypothesis of no association to the response is created by several replications
of permuting the response, growing an RF and computing the variable importance. The authors
recommend 50-100 permutations. However, much larger numbers have to be used to estimate more
precise p-values. We add 1 to the numerator and denominator to avoid zero p-values.
Value
Variable importance and p-value for each variable.
