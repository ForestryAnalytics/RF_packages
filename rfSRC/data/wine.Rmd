## ``wine``: White Wine Quality Data

#### Description
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median
of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts) of white wine. Each expert graded the wine quality
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
