quantileReg Quantile Regression Forests
Description
Determines the conditional quantiles and conditional density for a regression forest. Applies to both
univariate and multivariate forests. Can be used for both training and testing purposes.
Usage
## S3 method for class 'rfsrc'
quantileReg(obj, oob = TRUE, prob = (1:10) / 10, newdata = NULL)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments 

obj A previously grown forest.
oob Return OOB (out-of-bag) quantiles? If false, in-bag values are returned.
prob Target quantile probabilities.
newdata Test data (optional) over which conditional quantiles are evaluated over.
#### Details
Given a regression forest, or a multivariate forest with at least one regression outcome, returns the
conditional quantiles for the target outcomes. Also returns the conditional density, which can be
used to calculate conditional moments, such as the mean and standard deviation.
#### Value 

Quantiles for each of the requested probabilities, conditional density (and conditional cdf) for each
unique y-value, are returned for each data point in the training set, or if a test set is provided, the
#### Value 
s are returned for each data point in the test data. If more than one target outcome is available,
the returned object will be a list of length equal to the number of target outcomes.

rfsrc Random Forests for Survival, Regression, and Classification (RF-SRC)
Description
Fast OpenMP parallel processing unified treatment of Breiman’s random forests (Breiman 2001) for
a variety of data settings. Applies when the y-response is numeric or categorical, yielding Breiman
regression and classification forests, while random survival forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008, 2012) are
grown for right-censored survival and competing risk data. Multivariate regression and classification
responses as well as mixed regression/classification responses are also handled. Also includes
unsupervised forests and quantile regression forests, quantileReg. Different splitting rules invoked
under deterministic or random splitting are available for all families. Variable predictiveness can
be assessed using variable importance (VIMP) measures for single, as well as grouped variables.
Missing data can be imputed on both training and test data; see impute. The forest object, informally
referred to as an RF-SRC object, contains many useful values which can be directly extracted
by the user and/or parsed using additional functions (see the examples below).
This is the main entry point to the randomForestSRC package. Also see rfsrcFast for a fast
implementation of rfsrc.
For more information about this package and OpenMP, use the command package?randomForestSRC.

#### Arguments 

formula A symbolic description of the model to be fit. If missing, unsupervised splitting
is implemented.
data Data frame containing the y-outcome and x-variables.
ntree Number of trees in the forest.
mtry Number of variables randomly selected as candidates for splitting a node. The
default is p/3 for regression, where p equals the number of variables. For all
other families (including unsupervised settings), the default is sqrt(p). Values
are always rounded up.
ytry For unsupervised forests, sets the number of randomly selected pseudo-responses
(see below for more details). The default is ytry=1, which selects one pseudoresponse.
nodesize Forest average number of unique cases (data points) in a terminal node. The
defaults are: survival (3), competing risk (6), regression (5), classification (1),
mixed outcomes (3), unsupervised (3). It is recommended to experiment with
different nodesize values.
nodedepth Maximum depth to which a tree should be grown. The default behaviour is that
this parameter is ignored.
splitrule Splitting rule used to grow trees. See below for details.
nsplit Non-negative integer value. When zero or NULL, deterministic splitting for
an x-variable is in effect. When non-zero, a maximum of nsplit split points
are randomly chosen among the possible split points for the x-variable. This
significantly increases speed.
importance Method for computing variable importance (VIMP). Because VIMP is computationally
expensive, the default action is importance="none" (VIMP can always
                                                    be recovered later using the functions vimp or predict). Setting importance=TRUE
implements permutation VIMP. See below for more details.
block.size Should the cumulative error rate be calculated on every tree? When NULL, it will
only be calculated on the last tree and the plot of the cumulative error rate will
result in a flat line. To view the cumulative error rate on every nth tree, set the
#### Value 
 to an integer between 1 and ntree. As an intended side effect, if importance
is requested, VIMP is calculated in "blocks" of size equal to block.size,
thus resulting in a useful compromise between ensemble and permutation VIMP.
The default action is to use 10 trees. See VIMP below for more details.
ensemble Specifies the type of ensemble. By default both out-of-bag (OOB) and inbag
ensembles are returned. Always use OOB values for interfence on the training
data.
bootstrap Bootstrap protocol. The default is by.root which bootstraps the data by sampling
with replacement at the root node before growing the tree (for sampling
                                                           without replacement, see the option samptype). If by.node is choosen, the data
is bootstrapped at each node during the grow process. If none is chosen, the
data is not bootstrapped at all. If by.user is choosen, the bootstrap specified by
samp is used. It is not possible to return OOB ensembles or prediction error if
by.node or none are in effect.
rfsrc 45
samptype Type of bootstrap when "by.root" is in effect. Choices are swr (sampling with
                                                                         replacement, the default action) and swor (sampling without replacement).
sampsize Requested size of bootstrap when "by.root" is in effect (if missing the default
                                                                  action is the usual bootstrap).
samp Bootstrap specification when "by.user" is in effect. This is a array of dim
n x ntree specifying how many times each record appears inbag in the bootstrap
for each tree.
membership Should terminal node membership and inbag information be returned?
  na.action Action taken if the data contains NA’s. Possible values are na.omit or na.impute.
The default na.omit removes the entire record if even one of its entries is NA (for
                                                                                x-variables this applies only to those specifically listed in ’formula’). Selecting
na.impute imputes the data. See below for more details regarding missing data
imputation.
nimpute Number of iterations of the missing data algorithm. Performance measures such
as out-of-bag (OOB) error rates tend to become optimistic if nimpute is greater
than 1.
ntime Integer value used for survival to constrain ensemble calculations to a grid of
ntime time points. Alternatively if a vector of values of length greater than
one is supplied, it is assumed these are the time points to be used to constrain
the calculations (note that the constrained time points used will be the observed
                  event times closest to the user supplied time points). If no value is specified, the
default action is to use all observed event times.
cause Integer value between 1 and J indicating the event of interest for competing
risks, where J is the number of event types (this option applies only to competing
                                             risks and is ignored otherwise). While growing a tree, the splitting of a node is
restricted to the event type specified by cause. If not specified, the default is
to use a composite splitting rule which is an average over the entire set of event
types (a democratic approach). Users can also pass a vector of non-negative
weights of length J if they wish to use a customized composite split statistic (for
                                                                                example, passing a vector of ones reverts to the default composite split statistic).
In all instances when cause is set incorrectly, splitting reverts to the default.
Finally, note that regardless of how cause is specified, the returned forest object
always provides estimates for all event types.
proximity Proximity of cases as measured by the frequency of sharing the same terminal
node. This is an nxn matrix, which can be large. Choices are "inbag",
"oob", "all", TRUE, or FALSE. Setting proximity = TRUE is equivalent to
proximity = "inbag".
distance Distance between cases as measured by the ratio of the sum of the count of
edges from each case to their immediate common ancestor node to the sum of
the count of edges from each case to the root node. If the cases are co-terminal
for a tree, this measure is zero and reduces to 1 - the proximity measure for
these cases in a tree. This is an nxn matrix, which can be large. Choices are
"inbag", "oob", "all", TRUE, or FALSE. Setting distance = TRUE is equivalent
to distance = "inbag".
forest.wt Should the forest weight matrix be calculated? Creates an nxn matrix which
can be used for prediction and constructing customized estimators. Choices are
46 rfsrc
similar to proximity: "inbag", "oob", "all", TRUE, or FALSE. The default is
TRUE which is equivalent to "inbag".
xvar.wt Vector of non-negative weights where entry k, after normalizing, is the probability
of selecting variable k as a candidate for splitting a node. Default is to use
uniform weights. Vector must be of dimension p, where p equals the number
of variables, otherwise the default is invoked. It is generally better to use real
weights rather than integers. With larger sizes of p, the slightly different sampling
algorithms used in the two scenarios can result in dramatically different
execution times.
yvar.wt NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: Vector of non-negative weights where entry k,
after normalizing, is the probability of selecting response k as a candidate for
inclusion in the split statistic in unsupervised settings. Default is to use uniform
weights. Vector must be of the same length as the number of respones in the
data set.
split.wt Vector of non-negative weights where entry k, after normalizing, is the multiplier
by which the split statistic for a variable is adjusted. A large value encourages
the node to split on the variable. Default is to use uniform weights. Vector
must be of dimension p, where p equals the number of variables, otherwise the
default is invoked.
case.wt Vector of non-negative weights where entry k, after normalizing, is the probability
of selecting case k as a candidate for the bootstrap. Default is to use uniform
weights. Vector must be of dimension n, where n equals the number of cases in
the processed data set (missing values may be removed, thus altering the original
                        sample size). It is generally better to use real weights rather than integers.
With larger sizes of n, the slightly different sampling algorithms used in the two
scenarios can result in dramatically different execution times. See the example
below for the breast data set for an illustration of its use for class imbalanced
data.
forest Should the forest object be returned? Used for prediction on new data and required
by many of the functions used to parse the RF-SRC object. It is recommended
not to change the default setting.
var.used Return variables used for splitting? Default is FALSE. Possible values are all.trees
which returns a vector where each element records the number of times a split
occurred on a variable, and by.tree which is a matrix recording the number of
times a split occurred on a variable in a specific tree.
split.depth Records the minimal depth for each variable. Default is FALSE. Possible values
are all.trees which returns a matrix recording the minimal depth for a variable
(columns) for a specific case (rows) averaged over the forest, and by.tree
which returns a three-dimensional array recording minimal depth for a specific
case (first dimension) for a variable (second dimension) for a specific tree (third
                                                                              dimension).
seed Negative integer specifying seed for the random number generator.
do.trace Number of seconds between updates to the user on approximate time to completion.
statistics Should split statistics be returned? Values can be parsed using stat.split.
... Further arguments passed to or from other methods.

#### Details
1. Families
Do *not* set this value as the package automagically determines the underlying random forest
family from the type of response and the formula supplied. There are eight possible scenarios:
  regr, regr+, class, class+, mix+, unsupv, surv, and surv-CR.
(a) Regression forests (regr) for continuous responses.
(b) Multivariate regression forests (regr+) for multivariate continuous responses.
(c) Classification forests (class) for factor responses.
(d) Multivariate classification forests (class+) for multivariate factor responses.
(e) Multivariate mixed forests (mix+) for mixed continuous and factor responses.
(f) Unsupervised forests (unsupv) when there is no response.
(g) Survival forest (surv) for right-censored survival settings.
(h) Competing risk survival forests (surv-CR) for competing risk scenarios.
See below for how to code the response in the two different survival scenarios and for specifying
a multivariate forest formula.
2. Splitrules
Splitrules are set according to the option splitrule as follows:
  • Regression analysis:
  (a) The default rule is weighted mean-squared error splitting mse (Breiman et al. 1984,
                                                                     Chapter 8.4).
(b) Unweighted and heavy weighted mean-squared error splitting rules can be invoked
using splitrules mse.unwt and mse.hvwt. Generally mse works best, but see Ishwaran
(2015) for details.
• Multivariate regression analysis: For multivariate regression responses, a composite normalized
mean-squared error splitting rule is used.
• Classification analysis:
  (a) The default rule is Gini index splitting gini (Breiman et al. 1984, Chapter 4.3).
(b) Unweighted and heavy weighted Gini index splitting rules can be invoked using
splitrules gini.unwt and gini.hvwt. Generally gini works best, but see Ishwaran
(2015) for details.
• Multivariate classification analysis: For multivariate classification responses, a composite
normalized Gini index splitting rule is used.
• Mixed outcomes analysis: When both regression and classification responses are detected,
a multivariate normalized composite split rule of mean-squared error and Gini
index splitting is invoked. See Tang and Ishwaran (2017) for details.
• Unsupervised analysis: In settings where there is no outcome, unsupervised splitting is
invoked. In this case, the mixed outcome splitting rule (above) is applied. See Mantero
and Ishwaran (2017) for details.
• Survival analysis:
  (a) The default rule is logrank which implements log-rank splitting (Segal, 1988; Leblanc
                                                                       and Crowley, 1993).
(b) logrankscore implements log-rank score splitting (Hothorn and Lausen, 2003).
• Competing risk analysis:
  48 rfsrc
(a) The default rule is logrankCR which implements a modified weighted log-rank splitting
rule modeled after Gray’s test (Gray, 1988).
(b) logrank implements weighted log-rank splitting where each event type is treated as
the event of interest and all other events are treated as censored. The split rule is the
weighted value of each of log-rank statistics, standardized by the variance. For more
#### Details see Ishwaran et al. (2014).
• Custom splitting: All families except unsupervised are available for user defined custom
splitting. Some basic C-programming skills are required. The harness for defining these
rules is in splitCustom.c. In this file we give examples of how to code rules for regression,
classification, survival, and competing risk. Each family can support up to sixteen
custom split rules. Specifying splitrule="custom" or splitrule="custom1" will trigger
the first split rule for the family defined by the training data set. Multivariate families
will need a custom split rule for both regression and classification. In the examples, we
demonstrate how the user is presented with the node specific membership. The task is
then to define a split statistic based on that membership. Take note of the instructions in
splitCustom.c on how to register the custom split rules. It is suggested that the existing
custom split rules be kept in place for reference and that the user proceed to develop
splitrule="custom2" and so on. The package must be recompiled and installed for the
custom split rules to become available.
• Random splitting. For all families, pure random splitting can be invoked by setting
splitrule="random". See below for more details regarding randomized splitting rules.
3. Allowable data types
Data types must be real valued, integer, factor or logical – however all except factors are
coerced and treated as if real valued. For ordered x-variable factors, splits are similar to real
#### Value 
d variables. If the x-variable factor is unordered, a split will move a subset of the levels
in the parent node to the left daughter, and the complementary subset to the right daughter. All
possible complementary pairs are considered and apply to factors with an unlimited number of
levels. However, there is an optimization check to ensure that the number of splits attempted
is not greater than the number of cases in a node (this internal check will override the nsplit
                                                   value in random splitting mode if nsplit is large enough; see below for information about
                                                   nsplit).
4. Improving computational speed
See the function rfsrcFast for a fast implementation of rfsrc. In general, the key methods
for increasing speed are as follows:
  • Randomized splitting rules
Trees tend to favor splits on continuous variables and factors with large numbers of levels
(Loh and Shih, 1997). To mitigate this bias and improve speed, randomized splitting can
be invoked using the option nsplit. If nsplit is set to a non-zero positive integer, then
a maximum of nsplit split points are chosen randomly for each of the mtry variables
within a node and only these points are used to determine the best split. Pure random
splitting can be invoked by setting splitrule="random". In this case, a variable is randomly
selected and the node is split using a random split point (Cutler and Zhao, 2001;
                                                           Lin and Jeon, 2006). Note when pure random splitting is in effect, nsplit is set to one.
• Subsampling
Subsampling can be used to reduce the size of the in-sample data used to grow a tree
and therefore can greatly reduce computational load. Subsampling is implemented using
options sampsize and samptype.
rfsrc 49
• Unique time points
For large survival problems, users should consider setting ntime to a reasonably small
#### Value 
 (such as 50 or 100). This constrains ensemble calculations such as survival functions
to a restricted grid of time points of length no more than ntime and considerably
reduces computational times.
• Large number of variables
Use the default setting of importance="none" which turns off variable importance (VIMP)
calculations and considerably reduces computational times when there are a large number
of variables (see below for more details about variable importance). Variable importance
calculations can always be recovered later using functions vimp or predict. Also consider
using the function max.subtree which calculates minimal depth, a measure of the
depth that a variable splits, and yields fast variable selection (Ishwaran, 2010).
• Factors
For coherence, an immutable map is applied to each factor that ensures that factor levels
in the training data set are consistent with the factor levels in any subsequent test data
set. This map is applied to each factor before and after the native C library is executed.
Because of this, if x-variables are all factors, then computational times may become very
long in high dimensional problems. Consider converting factors to real if this is the case.
5. Prediction Error
Prediction error is calculated using OOB data. Performance is measured in terms of meansquared-error
for regression, and misclassification error for classification. A normalized Brier
score (relative to a coin-toss) is also provided upon printing a classification forest.
For survival, prediction error is measured by 1-C, where C is Harrell’s (Harrell et al., 1982)
concordance index. Prediction error is between 0 and 1, and measures how well the predictor
correctly ranks (classifies) two random individuals in terms of survival. A value of 0.5 is no
better than random guessing. A value of 0 is perfect.
When bootstrapping is by.node or none, a coherent OOB subset is not available to assess prediction
error. Thus, all outputs dependent on this are suppressed. In such cases, prediction error
is only available via classical cross-validation (the user will need to use the predict.rfsrc
                                                  function).
6. Variable Importance (VIMP)
To calculate VIMP, use the option importance. Classical permutation VIMP is implemented
when permute or TRUE is selected. In this case, OOB cases for a variable x are randomly
permuted and dropped down a tree. VIMP is calculated by comparing OOB prediction performance
for the permuted predictor to the original predictor.
The exact calculation for VIMP depends upon block.size (an integer value between 1 and
                                                        ntree) specifying the number of trees in a block used to determine VIMP. When the value is 1,
VIMP is calculated by tree (blocks of size 1). Specifically, the difference between prediction
error under the perturbed predictor and the original predictor is calculated for each tree and
averaged over the forest. This yields the original Breiman-Cutler VIMP (Breiman 2001).
When block.size is set to ntree, VIMP is calculated by comparing the error rate for the
perturbed OOB forest ensemble (using all trees) to the unperturbed OOB forest ensemble
(using all trees). Thus, unlike Breiman-Cutler VIMP, ensemble VIMP does not measure the
tree average effect of x, but rather its overall forest effect. This is called Ishwaran-Kogalur
VIMP (Ishwaran et al. 2008).
A useful compromise between Breiman-Cutler (BC) and Ishwaran-Kogalur (IK) VIMP can be
obtained by setting block.size to a value between 1 and ntree. Smaller values are closer to
50 rfsrc
BC and larger values closer to IK. Smaller generally gives better accuracy, however computational
times will be higher because VIMP is calculated over more blocks.
The option importance permits different ways to perturb a variable. If random is specified,
then instead of permuting x, OOB case are assigned a daughter node randomly whenever a
split on x is encountered. If anti is specified, x is assigned to the opposite node whenever a
split on x is encountered.
Note that the option none turns VIMP off entirely.
Note that the function vimp provides a friendly user interface for extracting VIMP.
7. Multivariate Forests
Multivariate forests are specified by using the multivariate formula interface. Such a call takes
one of two forms:
  rfsrc(Multivar(y1, y2, ..., yd) ~ . , my.data, ...)
rfsrc(cbind(y1, y2, ..., yd) ~ . , my.data, ...)
A multivariate normalized composite splitting rule is used to split nodes. The nature of the
outcomes will inform the code as to the type of multivariate forest to be grown; i.e. whether it
is real-valued, categorical, or a combination of both (mixed). Note that performance measures
(when requested) are returned for all outcomes.
8. Unsupervised Forests
In the case where no y-outcomes are present, unsupervised forests can be invoked by one of
two means:
  rfsrc(data = my.data)
rfsrc(Unsupervised() ~ ., data = my.data)
To split a tree node, a random subset of ytry variables are selected from the available features,
and these variables function as "pseudo-responses" to be split on. Thus, in unsupervised mode,
the features take turns acting as both target y-outcomes and x-variables for splitting.
More precisely, as in supervised forests, mtry x-variables are randomly selected from the set
of p features for splitting the node. Then on each mtry loop, ytry variables are selected from
the p-1 remaining features to act as the target pseduo-responses to be split on (there are p-1
                                                                                 possibilities because we exclude the currently selected x-variable for the current mtry loop —
                                                                                 also, only pseudo-responses that pass purity checks are used). The split-statistic for splitting
the node on the pseudo-responses using the x-variable is calculated. The best split over the
mtry pairs is used to split the node.
The default value of ytry is 1 but can be increased by the ytry option. A value larger than 1
initiates multivariate splitting. As illustration, consider the call:
  rfsrc(data = my.data, ytry = 5, mtry = 10)
This is equivalent to the call:
  rfsrc(Unsupervised(5) ~ ., my.data, mtry = 10)
In the above, a node will be split by selecting mtry=10 x-variables, and for each of these a
random subset of 5 features will be selected as the multivariate pseudo-responses. The splitstatistic
is a multivariate normalized composite splitting rule which is applied to each of the
10 multivariate regression problems. The node is split on the variable leading to the best split.
Note that all performance values (error rates, VIMP, prediction) are turned off in unsupervised
mode.
9. Survival, Competing Risks
rfsrc 51
(a) Survival settings require a time and censoring variable which should be identifed in the
formula as the response using the standard Surv formula specification. A typical formula
call looks like:
  Surv(my.time, my.status) ~ .
where my.time and my.status are the variables names for the event time and status
variable in the users data set.
(b) For survival forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008), the censoring variable must be coded as a
non-negative integer with 0 reserved for censoring and (usually) 1=death (event). The
event time must be non-negative.
(c) For competing risk forests (Ishwaran et al., 2013), the implementation is similar to survival,
but with the following caveats:
  • Censoring must be coded as a non-negative integer, where 0 indicates right-censoring,
and non-zero values indicate different event types. While 0,1,2,..,J is standard, and
recommended, events can be coded non-sequentially, although 0 must always be used
for censoring.
• Setting the splitting rule to logrankscore will result in a survival analysis in which
all events are treated as if they are the same type (indeed, they will coerced as such).
• Generally, competing risks requires a larger nodesize than survival settings.
10. Missing data imputation
Setting na.action="na.impute" imputes missing data (both x and y-variables) using a modification
of the missing data algorithm of Ishwaran et al. (2008). See also Tang and Ishwaran
(2017). Split statistics are calculated using non-misssing data only. If a node splits on a variable
with missing data, the variable’s missing data is imputed by randomly drawing values
from non-missing in-bag data. The purpose of this is to make it possible to assign cases to
daughter nodes based on the split. Following a node split, imputed data are reset to missing
and the process is repeated until terminal nodes are reached. Missing data in terminal nodes
are imputed using in-bag non-missing terminal node data. For integer valued variables and
censoring indicators, imputation uses a maximal class rule, whereas continuous variables and
survival time use a mean rule.
The missing data algorithm can be iterated by setting nimpute to a positive integer greater
than 1. Using only a few iterations are needed to improve accuracy. When the algorithm is
iterated, at the completion of each iteration, missing data is imputed using OOB non-missing
terminal node data which is then used as input to grow a new forest. Note that when the
algorithm is iterated, a side effect is that missing values in the returned objects xvar, yvar are
replaced by imputed values. Further, imputed objects such as imputed.data are set to NULL.
Also, keep in mind that if the algorithm is iterated, performance measures such as error rates
and VIMP become optimistically biased.
Finally, records in which all outcome and x-variable information are missing are removed
from the forest analysis. Variables having all missing values are also removed.
See the function impute for a fast impute interface.

                                                                 average of 100 events). Also returned are matrices containing the CHF and survival function.
Each row corresponds to an individual’s ensemble CHF or survival function evaluated at each
time point in time.interest.
4. For competing risks, a matrix with one column for each event recording the expected number
of life years lost due to the event specific cause up to the maximum follow up (Ishwaran
                                                                                et al., 2013). Also returned are the cause-specific cumulative hazard function (CSCHF)
                                                                                  and the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for each event type. These are encoded as a
three-dimensional array, with the third dimension used for the event type, each time point in
time.interest making up the second dimension (columns), and the case (individual) being
the first dimension (rows).
5. For multivariate families, predicted values (and other performance values such as VIMP and
                                                error rates) are stored in the lists regrOutput and clasOutput which can be parsed using the
functions get.mv.error, get.mv.predicted and get.mv.vimp.
