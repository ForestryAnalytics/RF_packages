## plot.survival Plot of Survival Estimates

#### Description
Plot various survival estimates.
Usage
## S3 method for class 'rfsrc'
plot.survival(x, plots.one.page = TRUE,
              show.plots = TRUE, subset, collapse = FALSE,
              haz.model = c("spline", "ggamma", "nonpar", "none"),
              k = 25, span = "cv", cens.model = c("km", "rfsrc"), ...)
####Arguments
* x An object of class (rfsrc, grow) or (rfsrc, predict).
* plots.one.page Should plots be placed on one page?
  show.plots Should plots be displayed?
  subset Vector indicating which individuals we want estimates for. All individuals are
used if not specified.
* collapse Collapse the survival and cumulative hazard function across the individuals
specified by ‘subset’? Only applies when ‘subset’ is specified.
haz.model Method for estimating the hazard. See details below. Applies only when ‘subset’
is specified.
* k The number of natural cubic spline knots used for estimating the hazard function.
Applies only when ‘subset’ is specified.
span The fraction of the observations in the span of Friedman’s super-smoother used
for estimating the hazard function. Applies only when ‘subset’ is specified.

* cens.model Method for estimating the censoring distribution used in the inverse probability
of censoring weights (IPCW) for the Brier score:
  km: Uses the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
* ``rfscr``: Uses random survival forests.
* ``...`` Further arguments passed to or from other methods.

#### Details
If ‘subset’ is not specified, generates the following three plots (going from top to bottom, left to
                                                                   right):
  1. Forest estimated survival function for each individual (thick red line is overall ensemble survival,
                                                             thick green line is Nelson-Aalen estimator).
2. Brier score (0=perfect, 1=poor, and 0.25=guessing) stratified by ensemble mortality. Based
on the IPCW method described in Gerds et al. (2006). Stratification is into 4 groups corresponding
to the 0-25, 25-50, 50-75 and 75-100 percentile values of mortality. Red line is the
overall (non-stratified) Brier score.
3. Plot of mortality of each individual versus observed time. Points in blue correspond to events,
black points are censored observations.
When ‘subset’ is specified, then for each individual in ‘subset’, the following three plots are
generated:
  1. Forest estimated survival function.
2. Forest estimated cumulative hazard function (CHF) (displayed using black lines). Blue lines
are the CHF from the estimated hazard function. See the next item.
3. A smoothed hazard function derived from the forest estimated CHF (or survival function).
The default method, ‘haz.model="spline"’, models the log CHF using natural cubic splines
as described in Royston and Parmar (2002). The lasso is used for model selection, implemented
using the glmnet package (this package must be installed for this option to work).
If ‘haz.model="ggamma"’, a three-parameter generalized gamma distribution (using the parameterization
                                                                           described in Cox et al, 2007) is fit to the smoothed forest survival function,
where smoothing is imposed using Friedman’s supersmoother (implemented by supsmu). If
‘haz.model="nonpar"’, Friedman’s supersmoother is applied to the forest estimated hazard
function (obtained by taking the crude derivative of the smoothed forest CHF). Finally, setting
‘haz.model="none"’ suppresses hazard estimation and no hazard estimate is provided.
At this time, please note that all hazard estimates are considered experimental and users should
interpret the results with caution.
Note that when the object x is of class (rfsrc, predict) not all plots will be produced. In
particular, Brier scores are not calculated.
Only applies to survival families. In particular, fails for competing risk analyses. Use plot.competing.risk
in such cases.
Whenever possible, out-of-bag (OOB) values are used.
plot.survival 27

#### Value
Invisibly, the conditional and unconditional Brier scores, and the integrated Brier score (if they are
                                                                                           available).

## veteran data
data(veteran, package = "randomForestSRC")
plot.survival(rfsrc(Surv(time, status)~ ., veteran), cens.model = "rfsrc")
## pbc data
data(pbc, package = "randomForestSRC")

# default spline approach
plot.survival(pbc.obj, subset = 3)
plot.survival(pbc.obj, subset = 3, k = 100)
# three-parameter generalized gamma is approximately the same
# but notice that its CHF estimate (blue line) is not as accurate
plot.survival(pbc.obj, subset = 3, haz.model = "ggamma")
# nonparametric method is too wiggly or undersmooths
plot.survival(pbc.obj, subset = 3, haz.model = "nonpar", span = 0.1)
plot.survival(pbc.obj, subset = 3, haz.model = "nonpar", span = 0.8)
