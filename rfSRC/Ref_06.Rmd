wihs Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS)
Description
Competing risk data set involving AIDS in women.
Format
A data frame containing:
time time to event
status censoring status: 0=censoring, 1=HAART initiation, 2=AIDS/Death before HAART
ageatfda age in years at time of FDA approval of first protease inhibitor
idu history of IDU: 0=no history, 1=history
black race: 0=not African-American; 1=African-American
cd4nadir CD4 count (per 100 cells/ul)
84 wine
Source
Study included 1164 women enrolled in WIHS, who were alive, infected with HIV, and free of clinical
AIDS on December, 1995, when the first protease inhibitor (saquinavir mesylate) was approved
by the Federal Drug Administration. Women were followed until the first of the following occurred:
treatment initiation, AIDS diagnosis, death, or administrative censoring (September, 2006). Variables
included history of injection drug use at WIHS enrollment, whether an individual was African
American, age, and CD4 nadir prior to baseline.

wine White Wine Quality Data
Description
The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median
of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts) of white wine. Each expert graded the wine quality
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
